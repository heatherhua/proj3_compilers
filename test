/*
Consider b.xy where b is undeclared. You report about b, but should you also report
that you canâ€™t apply swizzle to a non-vector type? If you assume that if b was supposed
to have been declared of the needed vector type, the second would also be fixed.
What about b.a = 10.0? b is still undeclared, but the vector swizzle is also not right.
Fixing the declaration of b won't fix the vector swizzle problem, so there are two errors
to report. 
Now consider b.a = 1 + 4.0. The error on the right side is yet another distinct error
(comingled int and float) and fixing the left hand side will not fix that error, so there are
three errors to report. The idea is that each distinct error that requires an independent
action to correct gets its own error message, but those errors due to the same root
cause are not re-reported
